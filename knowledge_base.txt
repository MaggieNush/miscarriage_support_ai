# GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT MISCARRIAGE

## DEFINITION

A miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the fetus is considered viable—most commonly before the 20th week of gestation. However, some organizations use viability thresholds of 24 weeks or a fetal weight under 500 grams.
Miscarriage is a common occurrence, affecting approximately 10–20% of recognized pregnancies, though the true figure may be higher, as many losses happen before a pregnancy is even confirmed.
Most miscarriages occur during the first trimester (before 12 weeks). The majority result from chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo and are **not** caused by stress, physical activity, or anything the pregnant person did or did not do.

## COMMON PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS

The physical signs of a miscarriage vary, but the most frequent symptoms include:

* **Vaginal bleeding** – Ranges from light spotting to heavy bleeding with clots or tissue.
* **Abdominal cramps** – Cramping that may feel like a period or be more intense.
* **Passing tissue** – Some people notice clots or grayish tissue passing from the vagina.
* **Loss of pregnancy symptoms** – Such as a sudden stop in nausea or breast tenderness.

Mild bleeding or cramping can occur in healthy pregnancies too, so any symptoms should be reviewed by a healthcare provider.

## COMMON EMOTIONAL IMPACT

The emotional response to miscarriage is deeply personal and can include:

* **Grief, sadness, and shock**
* **Anger, guilt, or self-blame**
* **Emotional numbness or disbelief**
* **Anxiety about future pregnancies**

These feelings are normal and may persist for weeks or months. In many societies, miscarriage is still surrounded by silence and stigma, making it harder to seek emotional support. Partners and family members may also grieve and need care.

* **Peer support groups** – Online or in-person groups (like those hosted by *Still A Mum*) help people process loss by connecting with others who have experienced it.
* **Crisis lines and helplines** – Organizations such as Marie Stopes Kenya offer immediate support and safe spaces to talk.
* **Family and community** – Trusted friends, family members, or community leaders can offer comfort and practical support.

In Kenya, *Still A Mum* provides peer support circles, mental health education, and national advocacy to normalize conversations around child loss.
